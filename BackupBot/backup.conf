# Backup Configuration File
# Author: @pwnjack
# License: MIT
#
# This configuration file contains the settings for the backup script. It defines
# the resources and parameters the script will use to perform backups. Please
# ensure you have the correct settings before running the script as it will
# affect where and how your data is backed up.
#
# Each setting is explained below:
#
# - HOSTS_FILE: The file containing the list of hosts to back up.
# - PASSPHRASE_FILE: The file containing the passphrase for encrypted backups.
# - SSH_KEY: The path to the SSH private key for secure connections.
# - EXCLUDE_FILE: A file listing patterns to exclude from the backup.
# - BACKUP_DIR: The directory where backups will be stored.
# - TEMP_DIR: Temporary directory for holding data during backup process.
# - LOG_FILE: File where the backup logs will be stored.
# - SILENT_MODE: If set to 1, the script will not output any messages.
# - VERBOSE_MODE: If set to 1, the script will output detailed messages.
#
# E-mail alert settings are also configured here to notify administrators of
# backup status. Ensure the email settings are correct to receive alerts.
#
# It is recommended to review and test your configuration before initiating
# a backup operation to prevent data loss or backup failures.
#
# For detailed usage and more configuration options, please refer to the
# accompanying documentation or the help section within the script.
