# SysTools: Lazy Smart Automation

## Overview

SysTools is a no-nonsense collection of scripts for those who automate not because they can, but because they're too lazy to do the same thing twice.

## Contents

- [BackupBot](./BackupBot/README.md) - Set it and forget it: automated backups with encryption.
- [CoinCheck](./CoinCheck/README.md) - Crypto at a glance: Get the latest coin values with a lazy one-liner.

## Setup

    git clone https://github.com/pwnjack/SysTools.git
    cd SysTools/<tool-name>

Check the README.md there for the next steps.

## Prerequisites

- Unix-like OS
- Required runtimes (Python, Bash, etc.)

## Usage

Clone. Navigate. Execute. Each tool's README.md is the manual.

## Note
